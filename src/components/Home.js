            <p>A home page (or homepage) is the main web page of a website. The term may also refer to the start page shown in a web browser when the
                application first opens. Usually, the home page is located at the root of the website's domain or subdomain. For example, if the
                domain is example.com, the home page is likely located at www.example.com/.

                Function

                A home page is the primary web page that a visitor will view when they navigate to a website via a search engine, and it may also function as a landing page
                to attract visitors. In some cases, the home page is a site directory, particularly when a website has multiple home pages.

                Good home page design is usually a high priority for a website; for example, a news website may curate headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links
                to full articles. According to Homepage Usability, the homepage is the "most important page on any website" and receives the most views of any page.
                A poorly designed home page can overwhelm and deter visitors from the site. One important use of home pages is 
                communicating the identity and value of a company. THANK YOU WIKIPEDIA!</p>

            <h3>The Hare & the Tortoise</h3>
        </div>


            <p>

A Hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow.

"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.

"Yes," replied the Tortoise, "and I get there sooner than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it."

The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started the runners off.

The Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Hare, he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up.

The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the Hare was sleeping. But the Hare slept on very peacefully; and when at last he did wake up, the Tortoise was near the goal. The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time.

    The race is not always to the swift.
